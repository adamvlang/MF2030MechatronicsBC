\section{Modeling}
\textbf{Validation}, are we designing the right system? Done with the
system requirements and specification in mind. \textbf{Verification}, are
we designing the system right? This is asked to the user to see if it
fulfills the task as good as possible. Models of a design solution are
intermediate results of system design. These models are verified and
assessed to the extent that is possible with a model (the model is not a
physical system). Since the model is just a model it is often not
capable to describe the whole system but will focus on a couple of
different aspects. They are often dynamic and they are often run in simulation
as an essential analysis of the models behaviour.
